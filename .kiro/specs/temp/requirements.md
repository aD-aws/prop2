# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Core Infrastructure MVP that establishes the foundational AWS services for a home improvement platform. The MVP focuses on authentication, database connectivity, and AI integration to create a deployable foundation that can be incrementally expanded.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register and login to the platform, so that I can access personalized features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL provide registration and login forms
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL use AWS Cognito to create and verify their account
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate via AWS Cognito and redirect to a dashboard
4. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with appropriate messaging
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Database Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information stored securely, so that I can access it across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL store their profile in DynamoDB
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL retrieve their profile from DynamoDB
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL save changes to DynamoDB
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### Requirement 3: AI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with AI capabilities, so that I can test the platform's intelligent features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI test page THEN the system SHALL connect to AWS Bedrock
2. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL send it to Haiku 3 via Bedrock
3. WHEN Haiku 3 responds THEN the system SHALL display the response to the user
4. WHEN AI requests fail THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
5. WHEN AI responses are received THEN the system SHALL log the interaction for monitoring

### Requirement 4: Basic Web Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, functional web interface, so that I can easily navigate and test the platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the site THEN they SHALL see a landing page with login/register options
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN they SHALL see a dashboard with navigation
3. WHEN a user navigates THEN they SHALL have access to profile management and AI test pages
4. WHEN using the interface THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on mobile devices
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the interface SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5: Infrastructure and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application deployed on AWS with proper infrastructure, so that it's scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
2. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL use AWS Lambda for serverless backend functions
3. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL use API Gateway for REST API endpoints
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL use CloudFront for content delivery
5. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL have basic CloudWatch logging and metrics
